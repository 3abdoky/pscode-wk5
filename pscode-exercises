// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
    INPUT number
    IF (number MOD 2 == 0) THEN
        PRINT "The number is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT "The number is odd."
    ENDIF
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

BEGIN
    DECLARE numbers[5]
    DECLARE sum, average, min, max
    SET sum to 0
    
    FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
        INPUT numbers[i]
        sum = sum + numbers[i]
    ENDFOR
    
    SET average to sum / 5
    SET min to numbers[1]
    SET max to numbers[1]
    
    FOR i FROM 2 TO 5 DO
        IF numbers[i] < min THEN
            SET min to numbers[i]
        ENDIF
        IF numbers[i] > max THEN
            SET max to numbers[i]
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    PRINT "The average of the five numbers is " + average
    PRINT "The smallest number is " + min
    PRINT "The largest number is " + max
END
